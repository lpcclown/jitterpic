# jitterpic
add jitter noise to picture by using python


By using this python script, it can help you to add jitter noise to the original picture/photo/image.
We use these noise pictures as the original picture dataset's complement. To expect a better training result in CNN. 

The original pic:
![Alt text](/relative/path/to/1.png?raw=true "The original pic")
The noised pic:
![Alt text](/relative/path/to/2.png?raw=true "The noised pic")
